## How Help Goals / Why Master

I think Duke is beneficial for me to achieve my career goals

During my undergraduate study, I found that the the M.Eng. in ECE is a great fit for me, as I can make full use of my experiences to better understand the theories taught in this program. In return, Dukeâ€™s prestige faculty and wide platform will provide me with the opportunities to study in-depth specialization about this subject, and the alumni network of Duke will also be a great asset to my development in the future. This is why I am motivated to pursue the M.Eng. in ECE at Duke University. 

Upon obtaining my Master degree, in the short term, I expect to complete my program with excellent performance to consolidate my knowledge and become a reliable employer in a reputable company. In the long run, I would like to set up my own company and to promote promising products or service to better our lives. I firmly believe I can develop useful skills at Duke to achieve my dream.



## Solve Problems

I am not a native speaker of English so sSometimes it is inevitable to encounter some language problems in study and life, such as communication in teamwork. But I firmly believe that I am able to address these problems.

If I can handle the problems, I will redouble efforts to overcome them by myself. For example, I can adapt to the life and study at Duke University by reviewing the knowledge taught in class or trying to communicate with others after class. (thinking about the communication after our discussion and offer feedback to my teammates)

When realizing I might not deal with the problem timely, I would turn to my friends for help to ensure the smooth progress in my team. You know, Unity is strengh. And if they could solve them better and faster, why not reject others' help? And I am also willing to do them a favor too if I am capable. Therefore, I firmly believe I will not stuck in to the trouble of language during my graduate study at Duke.



## Community

As a first-generation college and international students, I cherish the opportunity to receive education and decide to study at UC, Davis after careful consideration. I hope to promote the diversified development to UC, Davis through my efforts. 

During my college life, I developed time management skills in my tenure as the vice president of the Table Tennis Association. To be more precise, I managed to balance well between course assignment and club activities, such as arranging Intercollegiate Table Tennis Competition agenda. Besides, as a group leader of Guangdong Science Center Volunteer, I led a team to help visitors. Under my instruction, our group had clear definitions of responsibilities, rewards and punishments, so that the ability of each member could be fully utilized. Aforementioned experiences make me a trustworthy leader and a good partner to work with.

I have never submitted my papers to two or more conferences, and there are always new ideas in my papers, which makes me a reliable researcher in work.
